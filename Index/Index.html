	<h2>Welcome to my page</h2>
</span>

<span>
	<b>
		<p>
		This page is all over my life where I will<br> write everything happened to me when<br> I fled as an immigrant from my country(Syria)<br> to Europe(Belgium).</b>
</span>

<span>
	<h3>The Begin:</h3>
</span>
<strong>
<span>

		<p>
		It all started in Syria, when<br>ISIS came to Syria and destroyed <br>everything and of course Bashar<br> Al Assad killed people as<br> well. In the beginning, it was all a little bit<br> calmer but there were protests with the president and<br> against him, as well as kidnappings for<br> ransom. People would block the streets so that<br> no one enters or exits it, they had very melee weapons<br> like knifes, sticks and rocks.
	</p>

</span>

<span>
	<p>
	One time, two <a href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-67eecfcbd46bc679ad24ca6de23294e0-c">RPG-7</a> hit our town one next to the house <br>of my grandmother; where I was as well, <br>the windows, the doors everything was shaking,<br> the horns of the cars were so loud. <br> The first rocket hit a house 50 meters next to us.<br> Me and my dad went to see what happened<br> and all other men and women of the street. <br> The second one hit the roof of<br> a house in the next neighborhood. Thanks god none of them exploded.
	</p>
</span>

<span>
	<p>
	The next couple of days went good until<br> one day at night we hard weapons<br> next to our house and at that moment<br> our neighbor was at our house.<br>
	and his house was really close to our house<br> but he couldn't go because some of ISIS men<br> were literally beside it, like there was<br> only one wall between us. We could hear everything they said.<br> We had to turn all lights off and be quite.

	</p>
</span>

<span>
	<p>
	The next day my dad decided to go and live with<br> my grandmother for a while then my dad<br> said it would be more safer if we went <br>somewhere else like Lebanon. So my dad<br> had to call to my school to tell them<br> that I will travel and if they let me pass the<br> year without doing my exams. My principle<br> said "no, that's not possible", so<br> I had to leave my school, I was at that moment like 9<br> about to be 10 years old. My dad had to quit his<br> job so he can pass the borders, because they wouldn't<br> let anyone pass that works for the government <br>and by that I don't mean like a police agent<br> or someone like that. My dad used to be<br> a train driver. What made him choose this<br> choice is because he couldn't go to his job anymore<br> because like I said in the beginning of my story,<br> that people of other towns and villages would<br> block the streets and there were no other ways<br> to go there and they said that if they see my dad again they will kill him.

	</p>
</span>

<span>
	<p>So after that we called a taxi to come pick us<br>up 2 days later to go to Lebanon, where we can<br>find a better life. When I arrived to the place in Lebanon<br>I looked around me and saw all this beauty <br> I was happy. I turned around and saw a big monastery we entered<br> there the priesters welcomed us joyfully and<br> we started get to know each other. </p>
